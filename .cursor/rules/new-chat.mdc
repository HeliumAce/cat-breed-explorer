# Rule: Generating a new chat with context from the previous chat

## Goal

To start a new Cursor agent chat while retaining a snapshot of context from the previous chat.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user indicates that they are going to start a new chat. 
2.  **Generate New Chat Prompt:** The AI will create a prompt that will be used in the new chat. This will include a snapshot of progress from the current chat, a list of relevant files, a summary of remaining work or tasks, and any other essential context.

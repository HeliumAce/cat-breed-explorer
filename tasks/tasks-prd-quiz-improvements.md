# Task List: Quiz Feature Improvements

## Relevant Files

- `src/hooks/useQuizState.tsx` - Quiz state management hook with progress calculation bug (line 14)
- `src/hooks/useQuizState.test.tsx` - Unit tests for quiz state hook
- `src/data/quizData.ts` - Quiz data configuration with slider step issue (question 3)
- `src/components/quiz/QuizProgress.tsx` - Progress bar component (works correctly, no changes needed)
- `src/components/quiz/QuizProgress.test.tsx` - Unit tests for progress bar component
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/SliderQuestion.tsx` - Slider question component (works correctly, no changes needed)
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/SliderQuestion.test.tsx` - Unit tests for slider question component
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/MultiSelectQuestion.tsx` - Multi-select component needing button styling
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/MultiSelectQuestion.test.tsx` - Unit tests for multi-select question component
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/CheckboxQuestion.tsx` - Checkbox component needing button styling
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/CheckboxQuestion.test.tsx` - Unit tests for checkbox question component

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

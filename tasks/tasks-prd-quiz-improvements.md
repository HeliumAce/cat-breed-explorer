# Task List: Quiz Feature Improvements

## Relevant Files

- `src/hooks/useQuizState.tsx` - Quiz state management hook with progress calculation bug (line 14)
- `src/hooks/useQuizState.test.tsx` - Unit tests for quiz state hook
- `src/data/quizData.ts` - Quiz data configuration with slider step issue (question 3)
- `src/components/quiz/QuizProgress.tsx` - Progress bar component (works correctly, no changes needed)
- `src/components/quiz/QuizProgress.test.tsx` - Unit tests for progress bar component
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/SliderQuestion.tsx` - Slider question component (works correctly, no changes needed)
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/SliderQuestion.test.tsx` - Unit tests for slider question component
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/MultiSelectQuestion.tsx` - Multi-select component needing button styling
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/MultiSelectQuestion.test.tsx` - Unit tests for multi-select question component
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/CheckboxQuestion.tsx` - Checkbox component needing button styling
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/CheckboxQuestion.test.tsx` - Unit tests for checkbox question component

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Analyze Current Quiz Implementation
  - [x] 1.1 Examine `src/components/quiz/QuizProgress.tsx` to understand current progress calculation
  - [x] 1.2 Review `src/hooks/useQuizState.tsx` to understand how progress is managed
  - [x] 1.3 Identify current slider implementation in `src/components/quiz/question-types/SliderQuestion.tsx`
  - [x] 1.4 Locate multi-select question rendering logic (steps 5 & 6)
  - [x] 1.5 Document current behavior and identify specific changes needed

- [x] 2.0 Fix Progress Bar Calculation Logic
              - [x] 2.1 Modify progress calculation to start at 0% instead of 14% on step 1
    - [x] 2.2 Update progress increment logic to add 14% after each "Next" button click
    - [x] 2.3 Remove redundant percentage text display (user feedback - cleaner UI)
    - [x] 2.4 Verify progress bar animation smoothly transitions to new values
    - [x] 2.5 Test progress bar behavior across all 7 quiz steps

- [x] 3.0 Update Slider Question for Smooth Interaction
      - [x] 3.1 Update slider configuration for smooth interaction (min: 0, max: 100, step: 0.1)
      - [x] 3.2 Update slider component to use midpoint default value for better UX
      - [x] 3.3 Slider maintains current min/max labels (already implemented)
      - [x] 3.4 Slider tested - smooth movement and correct matching confirmed
      - [x] 3.5 Fixed slider value mapping: convert 0-100 range to 1-5 scale for matching algorithm

- [x] 4.0 Implement Checkbox Styling for Multi-Select Questions
      - [x] 4.1 Identified: Step 5 uses MultiSelectQuestion, Step 6 uses CheckboxQuestion (both small checkbox styling)
      - [x] 4.2 Updated both MultiSelectQuestion and CheckboxQuestion to use button styling with checkbox icons
      - [x] 4.3 Step 5 now uses button styling (MultiSelectQuestion component updated)
    - [x] 4.4 Step 6 now uses button styling (CheckboxQuestion component updated)
      - [x] 4.5 Checkboxes now have full-width background, hover states, and amber selected styling
      - [x] 4.6 Multi-select validation confirmed working + slider default validation fixed
      - [x] 4.7 Checkbox interactions and visual feedback tested and working

- [x] 5.0 Test and Validate Quiz Improvements  
  - [x] 5.1 Unit tests skipped per user request
  - [x] 5.2 Unit tests skipped per user request
  - [x] 5.3 Unit tests skipped per user request
  - [x] 5.4 Manual testing completed throughout implementation
  - [x] 5.5 Progress percentages verified: 0%, 14%, 28%, 42%, 57%, 71%, 86%
  - [x] 5.6 Quiz completion and matching algorithm tested and working
  - [x] 5.7 Visual consistency validated across all question types

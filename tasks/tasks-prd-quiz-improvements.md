# Task List: Quiz Feature Improvements

## Relevant Files

- `src/components/quiz/QuizProgress.tsx` - Progress bar component that needs calculation fix
- `src/components/quiz/QuizProgress.test.tsx` - Unit tests for progress bar component
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/SliderQuestion.tsx` - Slider question component needing smooth interaction
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/SliderQuestion.test.tsx` - Unit tests for slider question component
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/MultiSelectQuestion.tsx` - Multi-select question component needing checkbox styling
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/MultiSelectQuestion.test.tsx` - Unit tests for multi-select question component
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/CheckboxQuestion.tsx` - New checkbox question component (may need creation)
- `src/components/quiz/question-types/CheckboxQuestion.test.tsx` - Unit tests for checkbox question component
- `src/hooks/useQuizState.tsx` - Quiz state management hook that handles progress calculation
- `src/hooks/useQuizState.test.tsx` - Unit tests for quiz state hook
- `src/data/quizData.ts` - Quiz data configuration (reference for question types)

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

## Tasks

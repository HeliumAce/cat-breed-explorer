# Product Requirements Document: Quiz Feature Improvements

## Introduction/Overview

The Cat Breed Explorer quiz feature currently has three user experience issues that are impacting the overall quiz interaction quality:

1. **Progress Bar Issue**: The progress bar starts at 14% on step 1 before the user completes any questions, creating confusion about actual progress
2. **Slider Interaction**: The slider question (step 3: "Your tolerance for chatty companions") uses discrete steps instead of providing a smooth sliding experience
3. **Multi-Select Question Types**: Steps 5 and 6 are already multi-select questions but need updated checkbox styling instead of radio button styling

These improvements will enhance the user experience by providing clearer progress feedback and more appropriate input methods for different question types.

## Goals

1. **Accurate Progress Tracking**: Implement a progress bar that accurately reflects quiz completion, starting at 0% and incrementing after each question is answered
2. **Improved Slider Interaction**: Provide a smooth, continuous slider experience without discrete steps for better user control
3. **Proper Multi-Select UI**: Update existing multi-select questions to use checkbox styling instead of radio button styling to match user expectations

## User Stories

- **As a quiz taker**, I want to see accurate progress tracking so that I understand how much of the quiz I've completed
- **As a quiz taker**, I want to smoothly adjust slider values so that I can express my preferences more precisely
- **As a quiz taker**, I want multi-select questions to visually appear as checkboxes so that I understand I can select multiple options
- **As a quiz taker**, I want consistent visual styling across all question types so that the interface feels cohesive

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Progress Bar Improvements
1.1. The progress bar must start at 0% when the quiz begins (step 1)
1.2. The progress bar must increment by 1/7th (14%) after each "Next" button click
1.3. The progress percentage text must update to reflect the new completion percentage
1.4. The progress bar animation must smoothly transition to the new percentage value

### 2. Slider Question Improvements (Step 3)
2.1. The slider for "Your tolerance for chatty companions" must allow smooth, continuous movement
2.2. The slider must not have discrete steps or snap-to positions
2.3. The slider range must be 0-100 internally but not display numeric values to the user
2.4. The slider must maintain the current min/max labels ("Blessed silence please" / "Tell me EVERYTHING")
2.5. The slider must retain its current styling and visual appearance

### 3. Multi-Select Question Improvements (Steps 5 & 6)
3.1. Step 5 ("Other than potential cats, your home contains...") must use checkbox styling instead of radio button styling
3.2. Step 6 ("Which would be absolute cat-astrophes for you?") must use checkbox styling instead of radio button styling
3.3. Both questions must maintain the current full-width background styling for options
3.4. Both questions must maintain the current hover and selected state styling
3.5. Both questions must require at least one selection before allowing progression (current behavior)
3.6. The checkbox styling must be consistent with the overall quiz design system

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Mobile responsiveness improvements (saved for future iteration)
- Quiz result algorithm changes or hairless cat recommendation weighting
- Changes to question content or wording
- Addition of new question types
- Changes to quiz validation logic beyond the specified requirements
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility improvements beyond standard checkbox implementation

## Design Considerations

- **Visual Consistency**: All question types should maintain the current visual design language
- **Interaction Patterns**: Multi-select questions should feel natural and intuitive with checkbox interactions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Changes should not break existing functionality
- **Component Reusability**: Leverage existing UI components where possible

## Technical Considerations

- **Current Implementation**: The quiz uses a slider component for step 3 with `step: 1` configuration
- **Multi-Select Handling**: Steps 5 and 6 are already configured as multi-select questions in the quiz data
- **Progress Calculation**: Current progress calculation logic needs adjustment to start from 0%
- **State Management**: Existing quiz state management should accommodate multi-select values
- **Component Architecture**: May need to create or modify checkbox question component

## Success Metrics

Success will be measured by user feedback and satisfaction, specifically:
- User feedback on the improved quiz experience
- Qualitative assessment of the smoother interaction patterns
- Validation that progress tracking feels accurate and helpful
- Confirmation that multi-select questions collect the intended data

## Open Questions

1. **Progress Bar Timing**: Should the progress bar update immediately when an answer is selected, or only when "Next" is clicked?
2. **Slider Value Mapping**: How should the 0-100 slider values map to the existing quiz matching algorithm?
3. **Validation Messages**: Do we need to update any validation messages for the multi-select questions with new styling?

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Progress bar fix (impacts all quiz interactions)
2. **Medium Priority**: Multi-select questions (impacts data quality)
3. **Low Priority**: Slider smoothing (nice-to-have improvement)

# PRD: Supabase to Vercel Migration for Cat Breed Explorer

## Introduction/Overview

This project involves migrating the Cat Breed Explorer application from Supabase to Vercel to eliminate the $10/month hosting cost while maintaining 100% feature parity. The migration will replace two Supabase Edge Functions with Vercel API routes, implement security best practices, and provide a complete deployment solution with optional custom domain setup.

**Problem Statement**: Current Supabase dependency costs $10/month for a simple project that only needs secure API key proxy functionality for Google Maps integration.

**Goal**: Achieve zero monthly hosting costs by migrating to Vercel's free tier while maintaining all current functionality and implementing modern web security practices.

## Goals

1. **Cost Elimination**: Reduce monthly hosting costs from $10 to $0
2. **Feature Parity**: Maintain 100% of current application functionality
3. **Security Enhancement**: Implement modern security best practices for API key management
4. **Production Readiness**: Deploy a fully functional production application
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Provide comprehensive documentation for ongoing maintenance

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to eliminate monthly hosting costs so that I can run this personal project sustainably.

2. **As an end user**, I want the cat breed explorer to work exactly as before so that my experience is uninterrupted.

3. **As a developer**, I want to learn security best practices so that I can apply them to future projects.

4. **As a developer**, I want clear documentation so that I can maintain and update the application independently.

5. **As an end user**, I want the application to load quickly and reliably so that I can explore cat breeds efficiently.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Migration Requirements

1. The system must convert the `get-google-maps-key` Supabase Edge Function to a Vercel API route at `/api/google-maps-key`
2. The system must convert the `get-adoption-locations` Supabase Edge Function to a Vercel API route at `/api/adoption-locations`
3. The system must update frontend API calls to use new Vercel endpoints instead of Supabase function calls
4. The system must securely store the Google Maps API key as a Vercel environment variable
5. The system must maintain identical API response formats to ensure frontend compatibility
6. The system must handle CORS properly for cross-origin requests
7. The system must implement proper error handling and logging

### Security Requirements

8. The system must never expose API keys in client-side code
9. The system must use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
10. The system must implement proper HTTP security headers
11. The system must validate all incoming API requests
12. The system must sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks
13. The system must implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
14. The system must use HTTPS for all production traffic

### Deployment Requirements

15. The system must deploy automatically from GitHub repository
16. The system must support both Vercel subdomain and custom domain options
17. The system must provide automatic SSL certificate generation
18. The system must support environment-specific configurations (development/production)
19. The system must implement proper build optimization for production

### Monitoring Requirements

20. The system must provide deployment status monitoring
21. The system must log API errors for debugging
22. The system must monitor API usage to stay within free tier limits
23. The system must provide performance metrics for API response times

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Feature Enhancements**: No new features or functionality changes during migration
2. **UI/UX Changes**: No modifications to the user interface or user experience
3. **Database Integration**: No addition of persistent data storage (staying serverless)
4. **Advanced Analytics**: No implementation of detailed user tracking or analytics
5. **Multi-Environment Setup**: No staging or testing environment configuration
6. **Performance Optimization**: No performance improvements beyond maintaining current levels
7. **Mobile App Development**: No native mobile application development
8. **API Versioning**: No implementation of API versioning strategies

## Design Considerations

### API Route Structure
- Maintain RESTful conventions for new API routes
- Use consistent error response format across all endpoints
- Implement proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios

### Security Architecture
- Environment variables for sensitive data (API keys, configuration)
- Server-side API key validation and proxy pattern
- Client-side API calls only to Vercel API routes (never direct to Google APIs)

### Development Workflow
- GitHub integration for automatic deployments
- Branch preview deployments for testing
- Clear separation between development and production configurations

## Technical Considerations

### Migration Dependencies
- Node.js 18+ compatibility for Vercel runtime
- Existing React/Vite frontend framework (no changes needed)
- Google Maps JavaScript API and Places API integration
- GitHub repository for deployment source

### Vercel Free Tier Limits
- 100GB bandwidth per month
- 100 GB-hours serverless function execution
- Unlimited deployments and preview environments
- Automatic HTTPS and global CDN

### API Rate Limiting Strategy
- Implement basic rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Monitor Google Maps API usage to avoid unexpected charges
- Consider caching strategies for frequently requested data

### Environment Variable Management
- Development environment variables for local testing
- Production environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Clear documentation for variable configuration

## Success Metrics

1. **Cost Reduction**: Monthly hosting cost reduced from $10 to $0 ✅
2. **Functional Parity**: All existing features work identically ✅
3. **Performance Maintenance**: API response times remain equivalent or better ✅
4. **Security Implementation**: Modern security practices implemented ✅
5. **Deployment Success**: Application accessible via custom or Vercel domain ✅
6. **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive maintenance documentation provided ✅

### Measurable Targets
- Migration completed within 4-hour timeline
- Zero breaking changes in user functionality
- Zero exposed API keys in client-side code
- Successful production deployment with SSL
- Complete removal of Supabase dependencies

## Security Best Practices Checklist

### Environment Management
- [ ] API keys stored as environment variables only
- [ ] No sensitive data in repository code
- [ ] Separate development and production configurations
- [ ] Environment variable validation on startup

### API Security
- [ ] Input validation on all API endpoints
- [ ] Proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Error message sanitization (no sensitive data exposure)
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement in production

### Deployment Security
- [ ] Automatic SSL certificate generation
- [ ] Security headers implementation
- [ ] No debug information in production builds
- [ ] Proper error logging without data exposure

## Open Questions

1. **Domain Timeline**: Should we set up the custom domain immediately or use Vercel subdomain initially for testing?

2. **API Rate Limiting**: What rate limits should we implement to balance user experience with abuse prevention?

3. **Error Monitoring**: Do you want to integrate with any error monitoring services (Sentry, etc.) or keep it simple?

4. **Backup Strategy**: Should we implement any backup mechanisms for the API key configuration?

5. **Future Scaling**: Any considerations for potential traffic growth that might exceed free tier limits?

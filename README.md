## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24 LTS** (run `nvm use`; minimum supported version: 22.12.0)
- **npm** package manager; use the committed `package-lock.json`
- **Google Maps API Key** with Places API enabled
- **Vercel CLI** (for local development): `npm i -g vercel`

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cat-breed-explorer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   nvm use
   npm ci
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file for local development
   echo "CLIENT_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_client_key_here" > .env
   echo "SERVER_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_server_key_here" >> .env
   echo "VITE_CAT_API_KEY=your_cat_api_key_here" >> .env
   ```
   
   **Note:** The CORS configuration automatically handles Vercel preview deployments using built-in environment variables. No manual domain updates needed for preview branches!

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   # Use Vercel dev for local development (includes API routes)
   vercel dev
   
   # Or for frontend-only development
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   ```bash
   # Vercel dev typically runs on:
   http://localhost:3000
   
   # npm run dev typically runs on:
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### 🚀 Production Deployment

For complete deployment instructions, see **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**

**Quick Deploy to Vercel:**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Add `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable
4. Deploy automatically!

## 🎮 Using the Application

1. **Starting the Quiz**:
   - Click on the "Take the Quiz" button on the homepage
   - Answer each question based on your preferences
   - View your personalized breed matches

2. **Browsing Breeds**:
   - Explore all cat breeds from the homepage
   - Click on any breed card to view detailed information
   - Use the search functionality to find specific breeds

3. **Finding Adoption Locations**:
   - Click "Adopt a Cat" from any breed page
   - Allow location access or enter your address
   - Browse nearby shelters, humane societies, and pet stores
   - Filter by location type (All Locations, Shelters, Humane Societies, Pet Stores)
   - View locations on an interactive map

## 🔄 Quiz Logic

The quiz uses a sophisticated matching algorithm that:
- Assigns different weights to each question based on importance
- Calculates compatibility scores with each breed
- Considers factors like energy level, affection, grooming needs, etc.
- Presents breeds ordered by match percentage

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and optimized for:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

## 🧪 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm test` - Verify the lint parser's project-service compatibility
- `npm run typecheck` - Check TypeScript types
- `npm audit` - Check production and development dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- `vercel dev` - Start local development server with API routes (recommended)
- `npm run dev` - Start frontend-only development server  
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Dependency security

Use Node 24 and `npm ci` locally and in deployments. npm's lockfile is the source of truth; the obsolete Bun lockfile has been removed.

The minimatch override is limited to `@typescript-eslint/typescript-estree`. Its current release still requests minimatch 10, which is affected by [GHSA-g3hv-75wg-m249](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g3hv-75wg-m249). Keep the override until typescript-eslint depends on minimatch 11.0.1 or later. The parser compatibility tests exercise its project-service glob matching.

### Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**:
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   
   # Start development server with API routes
   vercel dev
   
   # Make your changes with hot-reload
   ```

2. **Testing API Routes**:
   ```bash
   # Test Google Maps API key endpoint
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/google-maps-key
   
   # Test adoption locations endpoint
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/adoption-locations \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"lat":37.7749,"lng":-122.4194,"radius":5000}'
   ```

3. **Production Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Verify production build works
   npm run build
   
   # Push to GitHub (triggers automatic Vercel deployment)
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Architecture Guidelines

- **API Routes**: Place new serverless functions in `/api/` directory
- **Rate Limiting**: Use shared rate limiter for any new API endpoints
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in Vercel dashboard
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper CORS and error responses
- **Security**: Never expose API keys in client-side code
- **CORS Security**: Automatic preview deployment handling - no manual domain updates needed
- **Enterprise Compliance**: All endpoints include security headers for corporate environments
